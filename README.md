# Recipe Book Project - New Update

The intent of the project is to allow developers to build and deploy an application for 
recipe collection that can be printed as a fun team building project.  Originally built 
as a holiday recipe book.  This project can easily be repurposed for barbeque, cookies, 
drinks, etc.  The limit is your imagination.  

Utilizing this project as-is, you will need to make adjustments for the needs of team.
Items like recipe categories are hard coded in a yml file.
